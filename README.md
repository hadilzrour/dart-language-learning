**Dart Langage Training**

This repository contains my learning journal for the Dart language training. In this file, I'll record the concepts and topics I learn throughout the training.

- Introduction to Dart
- Installing and configuring the Dart development environment
- Getting started with Dart: Hello World!
- Basic variables and data types in Dart
- Control structures: loops (for, while) and conditions (if, else)
- Functions in Dart: declaration, arguments, return values
- Using packages and dependencies
- Classes and objects in Dart
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and access modifiers
- Exception handling in Dart
- Asynchronous programming with futures and streams

During my training on the Dart language, I adopted a structured approach to assimilate each new notion. As I progressed through the course on Udemy, I completed the practical exercises proposed to put my newly acquired knowledge into practice. This approach enabled me to consolidate my skills and better understand the fundamental concepts of the language.

Once I had completed the two courses on offer, I embarked on some concrete mini projects. I created a few functional modules using the Dart language, which enabled me to further explore the language's advanced features. 

By combining the theory of the course with practice through exercises and personal projects, I was able to significantly strengthen my understanding of the Dart language.
